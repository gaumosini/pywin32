# EPLAN Electric P8: A Powerful Electrical Engineering Design Program
 
EPLAN Electric P8 is a software that allows you to plan and manage your electrical design projects and assess their aspects. It is a commercial product that offers unlimited possibilities for project planning, documentation and management of automation projects. It has the ability to automatically connect, mend or break lines, to tag devices and add wire numbers and it automatically creates reports and BOM's[^1^].
 
EPLAN Electric P8 supports 32 or 64-bit systems and can work on Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 or 11[^1^]. However, some users may encounter difficulties when installing the software on Windows 7 64-bit due to the dongle emulator issue. A dongle emulator is a software that mimics the function of a hardware key (dongle) that is required to run the software. Some users may use a dongle emulator to bypass the hardware key requirement or to use the software on multiple computers.

There are different ways to install a dongle emulator on Windows 7 64-bit, but some of them may not work properly or may cause system errors. Therefore, it is recommended to follow the official instructions from EPLAN or contact their support team for assistance. Alternatively, some users have suggested using a virtual machine (VM) to run EPLAN Electric P8 on Windows 7 64-bit without a dongle emulator. A VM is a software that creates a virtual environment that simulates another operating system. For example, you can use a VM to run Windows XP on Windows 7 64-bit.
 
To use a VM to run EPLAN Electric P8 on Windows 7 64-bit, you will need to download and install a VM software such as VirtualBox or VMware Workstation. Then, you will need to create a virtual machine with Windows XP as the guest operating system and install EPLAN Electric P8 on it. You will also need to configure the network settings and share folders between the host and guest operating systems. Finally, you will need to insert the hardware key (dongle) into your computer and make sure it is recognized by the VM software.
 
By using a VM to run EPLAN Electric P8 on Windows 7 64-bit, you can avoid the dongle emulator issue and enjoy the features and benefits of the software. However, this method may have some drawbacks such as lower performance, compatibility issues or security risks. Therefore, it is advisable to use this method only as a temporary solution until you upgrade your operating system or find a reliable dongle emulator.
