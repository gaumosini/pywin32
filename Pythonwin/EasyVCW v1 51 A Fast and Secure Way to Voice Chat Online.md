You can also undo or redo your actions by clicking on the arrows on the bottom left corner.
 
You can also add some effects to your voice by clicking on the FX button on the bottom right corner. You will see a list of effects such as echo, reverb, distortion, chorus, flanger, and more. You can apply any of these effects by selecting them and adjusting their parameters with the sliders. You can preview the effect by clicking on the green button on the top right corner.
 
## Step 3: Export Your Voice
 
When you are happy with your voice clip, you can export it as a VCW file by clicking on the Save button on the top left corner. You will see a dialog box where you can name your file and choose a destination folder. Click on Save to complete the process.
 
You can now use your VCW file in any application that supports it. For example, you can import it into Unreal Engine by using Simple DirectMedia or Simple DirectPlay libraries [^2^].
