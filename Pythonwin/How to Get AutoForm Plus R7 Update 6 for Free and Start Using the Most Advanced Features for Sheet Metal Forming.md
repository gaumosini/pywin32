- Improved report generation in Excel format: Users can now import and process Excel files as report templates directly in AutoForm-ReportManager, as well as export reports generated in AutoForm-ReportManager to Excel. This allows users to customize their reports according to their specific needs and preferences.[^3^]
- Enhanced hemming simulation: Users can now simulate hemming processes with more flexibility and accuracy, thanks to the new option to define hemming parameters such as bead height, radius and groove. Users can also combine hemming with other processes such as flanging, trimming and springback compensation.[^1^]
- Extended material database: Users can access more than 2000 material cards from various steel and aluminum suppliers, covering a wide range of grades and properties. Users can also create their own material cards using AutoForm-MaterialFinder, which allows them to determine material parameters from experimental data.[^5^]
- Optimized solver performance: Users can benefit from faster and more robust solver performance, especially for large and complex models. The solver has been improved to handle nonlinearities, contact conditions, adaptive remeshing and parallel computing more efficiently.[^5^]
