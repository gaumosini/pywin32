If you need to burn CDs, DVDs or Blu-Ray discs with full control and flexibility, you might want to try BurnAware Professional. This powerful software lets you use multiple burners at the same time to produce different types of discs or make quick copies from one disc to another. You can also customize your discs with various features, such as data storage, bootable options, multimedia content, ISO images and more. BurnAware Professional supports both ISO and CUE/BIN formats for image files, and allows you to erase and reuse rewritable discs, create multisession discs that can be added to later, and extract specific files or tracks from existing discs. The program has a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to use even for beginners.
  
One of the main advantages of BurnAware Professional is its compatibility with a wide range of disc types and burners. You can use it to burn CD-R/RW, DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW, BD-R/RE, HD-DVD-R/RW and DVD-RAM discs, as well as dual layer and M-Discs. You can also use any type of burner, whether it is internal or external, USB or SATA. BurnAware Professional will automatically detect and use the optimal settings for each device.

Another feature that sets BurnAware Professional apart from other burning software is its ability to handle large amounts of data and files. You can burn up to 100 GB of data on a single Blu-Ray disc, or create a spanned disc set that can be split over multiple discs. You can also burn thousands of files or folders in one session, without worrying about file system limitations or errors. BurnAware Professional will sort and optimize the files for the best performance and reliability.
  
BurnAware Professional also offers some advanced tools for disc management and verification. You can use it to check the disc for errors, scan the surface for bad sectors, recover files from unreadable discs, or erase the disc securely. You can also view detailed information about the disc, such as manufacturer, media type, capacity, write speed and sessions. BurnAware Professional will help you keep your discs in good condition and protect your data from loss or damage.
