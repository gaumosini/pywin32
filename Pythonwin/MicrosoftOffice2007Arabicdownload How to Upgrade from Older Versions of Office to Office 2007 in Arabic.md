# How to Download and Install Microsoft Office 2007 Arabic
 
If you want to use Microsoft Office 2007 in Arabic, you have two options: you can either download the Office language interface pack (LIP) or the full Office 2007 Arabic version. In this article, we will explain the difference between these two options and how to download and install them on your computer.
 
## What is the Office language interface pack (LIP)?
 
The Office language interface pack (LIP) is a free add-on that changes the language of the ribbon and commands for some Microsoft Office applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. The LIP does not change the language of the documents or the spelling and grammar checkers. To use the LIP, you need to have a compatible version of Office 2007 installed on your computer in one of the supported languages[^2^].
