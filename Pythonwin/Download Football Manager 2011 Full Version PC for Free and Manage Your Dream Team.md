You will also need to master the various aspects of the game, from scouting and transfers to tactics and training. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you improve your skills and achieve your goals in Football Manager 2011.

- Use your assistant manager wisely. Your assistant manager can be a valuable source of information and advice, especially if he has good attributes in judging player ability, tactical knowledge, motivating, and man management. You can delegate some tasks to him, such as arranging friendlies, handling press conferences, or giving team talks. You can also ask him for feedback on your squad, tactics, or opponents.
- Scout smartly. Scouting is essential for finding new players and keeping an eye on your rivals. You should hire scouts with high attributes in judging player ability and potential, adaptability, and determination. You should also assign them to scout different regions, competitions, or players according to your needs and budget. You can also use filters and shortlists to narrow down your search and find the best players for your team.
- Build a balanced tactic. A good tactic is one that suits your players' strengths and weaknesses, as well as your preferred style of play. You should choose a formation that gives you stability in defense, creativity in midfield, and threat in attack. You should also select team instructions that match your philosophy and strategy. You should also assign player roles and duties that complement each other and create movement and space on the pitch.
- Train effectively. Training is important for improving your players' attributes, fitness, and morale. You should set up a training schedule that covers all the aspects of the game, such as tactics, ball control, defending, attacking, physical, and mental. You should also adjust the workload and intensity according to your players' age, condition, and personality. You should also monitor your players' progress and feedback regularly and make changes if necessary.
- Manage matches dynamically. Matches are where you put your skills to the test and where you can make a difference with your decisions. You should prepare well before each match by researching your opponent, setting up opposition instructions, and choosing your squad. During the match, you should pay attention to the match stats, analysis, and commentary. You should also use touchline shouts, substitutions, and tactical changes to influence the outcome of the game.

Football Manager 2011 is a challenging and rewarding game that will keep you hooked for hours. By following these tips and tricks, you will be able to master the game and lead your team to glory.
