Aramco is one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, with operations in more than 50 countries. Aramco has a high standard of quality and safety for its projects and products, and requires its suppliers to meet the same criteria. That's why Aramco has an approved vendor list (AVL), which is a list of suppliers that have been pre-qualified and evaluated by Aramco for their technical and commercial capabilities.
 
If you are a supplier who wants to do business with Aramco, you need to register on the Aramco e-Marketplace Platform, which is an online platform that connects Aramco with its potential and existing suppliers. Through this platform, you can create and update your supplier profile, receive and respond to requests for quotations (RFQs), participate in e-bidding and tendering, and manage contracts with Aramco.

However, registering on the Aramco e-Marketplace Platform does not guarantee that you will be included in the AVL. To be considered for the AVL, you need to go through a rigorous screening process that involves submitting various documents, such as company profile, financial statements, quality certificates, product catalogs, references, etc. You also need to pass a technical evaluation and an audit by Aramco experts.
 
Once you are approved as a vendor by Aramco, you will be assigned a vendor ID and a vendor category, which indicate your scope of supply and your level of performance. You will also be able to access the supplier portal, which is another online system that allows you to manage your daily business interactions with Aramco, such as invoicing, payment status, delivery tracking, etc.
 
Being an Aramco approved vendor gives you many benefits, such as access to Aramco's global network of projects and opportunities, exposure to best practices and standards in the industry, and potential for long-term partnership and growth with Aramco. However, being an approved vendor also comes with responsibilities and expectations. You need to maintain your quality and service levels, comply with Aramco's policies and procedures, and continuously improve your performance and capabilities.
