# How to Download and Install MS Office Proofing Tools 2007 for Greek Language
 
If you have an English version of MS Office 2007 and you want to use spelling and grammar check for Greek language, you may encounter a problem that says âcannot find proofing tools in Greekâ[^1^]. This means that you need to install proofing tools for Greek, which are not included in the English version of Office 2007.
 
Proofing tools are a set of software components that enable you to edit and proofread documents in different languages. They include features such as spell checker, grammar checker, hyphenator, thesaurus, and autocorrect[^2^]. Proofing tools for Office 2007 support 50 languages, including Greek[^2^].

However, finding and installing proofing tools for Greek in Office 2007 can be tricky, as they are no longer available from Microsoft's official website. According to a Microsoft MVP, the language packs for 2007 have been discontinued[^1^]. But don't worry, there is still a way to get them.
 
One option is to download them from an online archive, such as Archive.org. There you can find a file named MS\_Office\_Proofing\_Tools\_2007\_incl.\_SP1\_Greek.rar[^3^], which contains the proofing tools for Greek along with Service Pack 1 update. You can download this file by clicking on the link with the same name[^3^]. The file size is about 5.9 MB.
